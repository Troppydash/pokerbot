Algorithm
- SMD cluster for information set
- CFR algorithm precomputation
- CFR inference

Information set
- Position (bb, sb)
- Street (preflop, flop, turn, river)
- PublicCluster
    - Variants: preflop (0), flop (3), turn (4), river (5)
    - Each card group mapped to an equity histogram
        - bins are private hole cluster ids
        - heights are expected equity (when public cards + hole cards) (5x5x5 samples)
    - clustered into 1, 20, 30, 50 groups
- PrivateCluster
    - hole cards
    - each pair mapped to an equity distribution (probability of getting equity against random opp hand)
        - bins are probability ranges (10)
        - heights are the proportion of equities (against random opp hand) in range (50x49x1000 samples)
    - clustered into 20 groups
- Bets (fold, check, raise, all-in)
